# Project Summary

* I used Beautiful soup because I was more familiar with it. 

* I did not do the AI part of the assignment

* I did not do the AI part

* I mainly used VScode because it is the main thing that i code on. I also used Jupyter Notebook throughout to help me see the dataframes better. I used a lot of pandas because I am very familiar with using it especially because I have another class soley focused on it. 

* The queries were pretty easy to do. They went really quick and were quite simple so not much of a plan had to go into them. The hardest part was definitely the cleaning of the dataframes. The plan was to just take one column at a time and make sure my work was neat so that i did not get lost. It took me a long time but I eventually got there. The special characters that were hidden were also very annoying.
